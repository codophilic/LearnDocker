# Learn About Docker

## Why do we need Docker?

- Suppose there is an full stack application which uses different technologies like NodeJS, MongoDB, Nginx etc, which requires libraries , OS version ( checking the compatiblitiy which all tech agrees to run on that OS ) and other dependencies. 

- Apart from this if the application needs a new upgradation then again we need to check the compatiblity of those components.

- Suppose there are different environments for an application testing , again we need to make sure those environments must have the required components and compatiblity to host our applications.

- **So Docker help to solve these problem with the containers where all the components are placed in seperate containers consisting there required libraries and dependecies and those containers were executed**


## Basic concepts of Operating System 

- Every OS consits of two main common components , an **OS kernel and sets of software components** . So e.g for a Linux OS, the OS kernel which interacts with the underlying hardware is common for software components like Ubuntu,CentOS etc. These software components may have different user interfac, file managers etc. 

- The Docket containers share this underlying OS kernel.

- So let's say we have installed Docker on Ubuntu OS. So Docker can run any other type of Linux OS on top of Ubuntu because they share same OS kernel which is linux.

- So we cannot run a windows based container on a Docker host with Linux kernel. For that we will required Docker hosted on windows kernel.

- In windows we have a subsystem of linux where we can execute linux operations (WSL). So a linux container can be run on windows hosted docker.


## What are containers?

- A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. 

- A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. (1)

## What is Docker?

- Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. The isolation and security allows you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host. 

- Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you do not need to rely on what is currently installed on the host. You can easily share containers while you work, and be sure that everyone you share with gets the same container that works in the same way.

- Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. 

- By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.


## Comparing Virtual machines and Containers.

- Incase of docker we have the underlying hardware, on top of it the OS and then the Docker installed on that OS. Docker manages the containers and run with their libraries and dependencies. Incase of Virtual machines there is a hypervisor (A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor or VMM, is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). A hypervisor allows one host computer to support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing its resources, such as memory and processing. )on top of the hardware and on them the VM are there. Each VM has its own OS inside it with its dependencies and libraries.

- Incase of VM, higher utilization of hardware takes place since there are multiple OS kernels. It also consume higher disk space. Whereas dockers containers are light weight which also makes boot up process faster.

- Docker containers has less isolation and more resources are shared between the containers whereas VM's have complete isolation from each other. Since VM's don't rely on the underlying OS or kernel, we can run different OS. (2)

- Moslty Dockers and VM work together for an application. Dockers containers are hosted on VM's.


## Images and Containers.

- Images are read-only templates containing instructions for creating a container. A Docker image creates containers to run on the Docker platform.

- Think of an image like a blueprint or snapshot of what will be in a container when it runs.

- Images are built as a series of layers. Layers are assembled on top of one another. 

-Let's say we want to create a Docker image of a Hello World Java application. The first thing we need to think about is what does our application need.

- To start, it is a Java application, so we will need a JVM. OK, this seems easy, but what does a JVM need to run? It needs an Operating System. Therefore, our Docker image will have an Operating System layer, a JVM, and our Hello World application.

- A major advantage of Docker is its large community. If we want to build on to an image, we can go to Docker Hub and search if the image we need is available.

- A container is an instance of an image. Each container can be identified by its ID. Going back to our Java development analogy, we could say that a container is like an instance of a class. So images is a class and container is an object or instance of that class.

- Docker defines seven states for a container: created, restarting, running, removing, paused, exited, and dead. This is important to know. Since a container is just an instance of the image, it doesn't need to be running.

- E.g In docker if run command, docker run hello-world  

1) docker: It is docker engine and used to run docker program. It tells to the operating system that you are running docker program.

2) run: This subcommand is used to create and run a docker container.

3) hello-world: It is a name of an image. You need to specify the name of an image which is to load into the container.


## Docker Hub

- We can consider Docker Hub as a service from Docker for locating and distributing containers for each image within the specified team. It can manage the sharing and storage of Docker image.

- Docker Hub is a hosted repository service provided by Docker for finding and sharing container images with your team.

## Installing Docker

- Here we are installing a docker on windows host having linux vm which is Ubuntu OS. Commands used were curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh , sudo sh get-docker.sh 

- The installation steps will vary for windows and MacOS.

## Running a Docker command

- Running an image from Docker Hub repository having name whalesay (3)

## Docker commands

- Run command: Suppose if we run `docker run nginx` , this will run an instance of the nginx application from the docker host if it exists on the machine and if the image is not found then it will reach the docker hub to find the image and it will pull that image down in the machine ( It happens for the first time ).

- List command: 

- A. Suppose if we run `docker ps` or `docker container ls `it will list all running containers with some information about them like ID, image name, command, creation time etc. Each containers gets automatically a random ID and random name. (5)

- B. Suppose we want to list images  run command `docker images`. (8)

- Stop Command: Suppose if we want to stop a container we need to have its ID or name e.g `docker stop sleepy_diffie`.(6)

- Remove command: 

- A Suppose we want to remove containers permanently which takes up spaces we can run `docker rm ID` e.g `docker rm sleepy_diffie`. We cannot remove running containers in docker. (7)

- B. Suppose we want to remove an image permanently run command `docker rmi image_name`. Before deleting an image we need to be sure that no containers are running off to that inage .(9 10 )

- docker rm $(docker ps -aq) removes all containers.

- docker rmi $(docker images -q) removes all images

- Pull Command: We can just pull the image to store it on the host and not run the container. Command is `docker pull imagename`. (11)

- Containers lifespan: Containers are not meant to host an OS they are meant to run a specific task or process such as to host an instance of an image. Once the task is completed the container exits. A container only lives as long as the process inside it is alive. If the service inside the container is stopped or crash, then the container exits. You can refer the example whalesay image where the docker container after completion exited itself.

- Execute command: Suppose we want to run execute some commands on running containers we can do it using command `docker exec container_name COMMAND`. When we run `docker run ubuntu` it gets exited immedietly so we use a `sleep` command over it.  (12)

- Attach an Detach: Suppose when we run a container which uses an images that runs on CLI/ foreground like running a web server it called an attach state. This makes difficult to add any inputs to the docker containers.(13)
Docker provides to run such images in the background like a detach state. The container will continue to run in the backend. (14)
In the Detach state the docker provides an ID which can be use to attach it again.(15)

- Run a container with provided name: docker run -d --name name imagename

- Get the image based on Tag: Suppose if we require a particular of image to be run by the container we run command `docker run imagename:versionNumber`. So the `imagename:versionNumber` is called Tag. If we don't specifiy tag docker will consider the latest tag from the docker hub.(16)

- Providing STDIN: When we a image is run by container and suppose the image is requires input, docker container simple execute the task without prompting for an input. Docker containers does not listen to STDIN even though you are attached to the terminal. Docker containers runs in a non interactive mode. 
So to provide the input to make the docker containers as a interactive mode use `docker run -i imagename`. But even providing -i as an interactive option it won't show the prompt ( like any message which ask for an input e.g Enter the user name) because the due to -i it is attach on the OS terminal and not on the container terminal. So to get that prompt for questioning use `-it`. (17)


- Inspect Container: To get more details of a container run command `docker inspect ID_or_name`. (22)

- Logs of a container: Suppose we ran a detach container and we need to view logs of it so run command `docker logs ID_or_name`. (23)



- PORT Mapping: The underlying host where docker is installed is called a docker host or docker engine. Suppose we have web server application run on a docker container , we can see the web server but how other users can access my web application? Suppose my application runs on PORT 5000 so i can access it using that port number but what IP must be use for accessing it by me? Docker provides each containers IP so using that IP or using docker host IP. But containers host IP are only accessible from docker host machine (for me) for other users we need to provide docker host IP with required particular port mapping for accessing our containerized web application. 
To get container IP `docker inspect -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' container_name_or_id
`
Suppose we want to users to access our web server using port 80 and my docker host ip is 192.168.1.5 so we can do it by running port mapping command `docker run -p 80:5000 image_name`. So we can map multiple port with the provided port of the container , but we cannot use the same mapped port again for other application. 

(18 19 20 24)

Exposed ports are 3456 and 80 and publish ports are 3456 and 38080.

- Volume Mapping: Suppose we are running a mysql container and we added lost of data in that container. Suppose we stop or remove the container all the data inside that container gets destroyed. So to map those inside data of that container with outside container folder within the docker host run the command `docker run -v folderoutside:folderinsideContainer imagename`. (21) 


## Environment Variables

- Suppose there is a web-server application which uses a functionality background color. The web-server application sets that functionality as an Environment variable which state whenever we run that web-server application we can provide our own color to that environment variable and the web-page will have that background color. So here we have set environment variable as **APP_COLOR**. (25)

- Once that application is dockerized to provide that environment variable name use command `docker run -e ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAME=VALUE imagename`. (26,27)

- Inspect environment variable: Find all the environment variables of a running container using command `docker inspect CONTAINER_ID` which will have Config parameters which list all environment variables. (28)


## Docker Images

### Creating an Image of n application 

- Here we are containerize an application a simple web application based on flask.

- Before creating an image list down all requirements and steps for deploying an application. (29)

- After listing down all the steps create a file name **Dockerfile** which is our image. After writting the dockerfile we need to build it and provide it a tag. So use command `docker build Dockerfile -t DockerHubUsername/provideImageName`. 

- To make is available we need to push that build file. So run the command `docker push DockerHubUsername/provideImageName`. (30)

### Components of Dockerfile

- Dockerfile consits of two components 1. Instruction and 2. Argument

- Instruction are **FROM , RUN , COPY , ENTRYPOINT** (31). Each of them perform specific action while creating an image. 

- Arguments are the (32) text provided by users. 

- Every dockerfile will have an image based on OS and it will always start **FROM** instruction. The **RUN** instructions tells docker to install all dependencies (33). The **COPY** instruction copies the local files to the docker image. So here we are copying all the files *.* to inside of image folder */opt/source-code*. The **ENTRYPOINT** instruction allow us to specify a command that will be run when the image is run by the container.

### Images Layered architecture

- When docker builds an image it creates multiple layers. Each line of instructions creates a new layer in the Docker image taking the changes of the previous layers.

- Each layers stores the changes from the previous layer, it is reflected in the size. We can see this layers and information by running the command `docker history DockerHubUsername/provideImageName`. (34)

- We can see various steps involved when we run a docker build command.(35)

- All the layers are cached and if we one layers fails all layers after it does not get executed. After fixing the failure layer, when we run the docker build command it will directly starts from that layer where it fails. Even if we add a new layer in the dockerfile it will not start all over again. (36) Due to this images are build at a faster rate. This is helpful when there is an update in the source code of an application.
